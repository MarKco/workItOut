    <string name="app_info">A working day is a long day, but can be even longer if you don\'t remember the time you came in, or how many minutes you spent in lunchtime.\nThis is where WorkItOut comes handy: just press a button and you\'re done. Check-in when you get to the office, then with a tap you can tell when you went to lunch and when you came back. From then on a timer is going to tell you how long it takes before you can safely leave the workplace.\n\nBut that\'s not the end! WorkItOut is notifying you when the working time is supposed to end. You can also export your daily timetable as email and send it to yourself in order to keep a tracking of your overtime.\nWorking time duration is completely customizable, the app is light, fast and completely ad-free.\n\nIt\'s time to WorkItOut.\n\nDo you like WorkItOut and would like to helo by testing new features?
